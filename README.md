        Develop and deploy new services, features and improvements, working with the Product Team, fellow back end developers, and with front end developers to interface with their UI

        Review other developers’ code and coach less experienced developers
        Help our Support and SRE teams diagnose and fix issues to ensure the stability of the platform
