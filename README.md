MEE6’s vision is to become a global brand for community management on Discord and beyond, using our large distribution to develop and market innovative products and services.

We are uniquely positioned to do that - and yet we’re a surprisingly small and flexible company. MEE6 is self-funded since day 1 and very solid financially, which gives us full control over our strategy and frees us from the distractions and contraints of a constant race for fundraising.


We are looking for a back end developer with a solid experience with Python to help us develop and scale MEE6.
In this job, you will:

        Develop and deploy new services, features and improvements, working with the Product Team, fellow back end developers, and with front end developers to interface with their UI
        Continuously improve the quality and maintainability of the platform by promoting clean architecture principles and improving the existing code base architecture and testing
        Review other developers’ code and coach less experienced developers
        Help our Support and SRE teams diagnose and fix issues to ensure the stability of the platform

Our stack

        Back end: Python/Flask, Go, MongoDB, Redis
        Front end: React
        DevOps: Kubernetes/Helm (70+ nodes, 10K containers), Docker, Flux, MongoDB, InfluxDB
        Crypto: Solidity

About you

You would be a good fit at MEE6 if most of this sounds like you:

- Passionate about building products
- Experienced in using one or more of our stack’s technologies, but above all curious and eager to learn
- Self-starting and entrepreneurial
- Humble and still willing to grow (no matter your seniority!)
- Collaborative, enthusiastic about teamwork, learning, and teaching
- Fluent in English

Why join us?

You will have an impact. Your work will immediately make a difference for millions of users.

Whether you’re a beginner or a veteran, you will have many opportunities to learn. Our product evolves and scales fast, yielding many challenges.

You will help make technical decisions collaboratively and rationally rather than following the latest trends or manifestos.

You will work in a multi-cultural team of passionate, trusting, and friendly colleagues. You will always be able to count on them for help, and you will have the satisfaction of helping them in return.

You will be recognized solely for your skills and your engagement, with no consideration of origin, belief, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, age, or any other non-professional criteria.
